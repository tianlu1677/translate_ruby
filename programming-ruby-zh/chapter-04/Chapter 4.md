Chapter 4
====
Containers, Blocks, and Iterators
=====

Most real programs deal with collections of data: the people in a course, the songs in your playlist, the books in the store. Ruby comes with two built-in classes to handle these collections: arrays and hashes.[22] Mastery of these two classes is key to being an effective Ruby programmer. This mastery may take some time, because both classes have large interfaces.

But it isn’t just these classes that give Ruby its power when dealing with collections. Ruby also has a block syntax that lets you encapsulate chunks of code. When paired with collections, these blocks become powerful iterator constructs. In this chapter, we’ll look at the two collection classes as well as blocks and iterators.
