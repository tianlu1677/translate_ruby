4.2 Hashes
====
Hashes​ (sometimes known as ​ associative arrays​ , ​ maps​ , or ​ dictionaries​ ) are similar to arrays in that they are indexed collections of object references. However, while you index arrays with integers, you index a hash with objects of any type: symbols, strings, regular expressions, and so on. When you store a value in a hash, you actually supply two objects—the index, which is normally called the ​ key​ , and the entry to be stored with that key. You can subsequently retrieve the entry by indexing the hash with the same key value that you used to store it.

The example that follows uses hash literals—a list of ​key ​ ​value​ pairs between braces:
```ruby
h = { ​'dog'​ => ​'canine'​, ​'cat'​ => ​'feline'​, ​'donkey'​ => ​'asinine'​ }
h.length  ​# => 3​​ 	
h[​'dog'​]  ​# => "canine"​​ 	
h[​'cow'​] = ​'bovine'​​ 	
h[12]    = ​'dodecine'​ 	
h[​'cat'​] = 99​ 	
h         ​# => {"dog"=>"canine", "cat"=>99, "donkey"=>"asinine", "cow"=>"bovine",​​ 	
          ​# .. 12=>"dodecine"}​
```
In the previous example, the hash keys were strings, and the hash literal used ​=>​ to separate the keys from the values. From Ruby 1.9, there is a new shortcut you can use if the keys are ​symbols​. In that case, you can still use ​=>​ to separate keys from values:
```ruby
h = { :dog => ​'canine'​, :cat => ​'feline'​, :donkey => ​'asinine'​ }
```
but you can also write the literal by moving the colon to the end of the symbol and dropping the ​=>​:
```ruby
h = { dog: ​'canine'​, cat: ​'feline'​, donkey: ​'asinine'​ }
```
Compared with arrays, hashes have one significant advantage: they can use any object as an index. And you’ll find something that might be surprising: Ruby remembers the order in which you add items to a hash. When you subsequently iterate over the entries, Ruby will return them in that order.

You’ll find that hashes are one of the most commonly used data structures in Ruby. The reference section has a list of the methods implemented by class ​Hash​.

Word Frequency: Using Hashes and Arrays
Let’s round off this section with a simple program that calculates the number of times each word occurs in some text. (So, for example, in this sentence, the word ​the​ occurs two times.)

The problem breaks down into two parts. First, given some text as a string, return a list of words. That sounds like an array. Then, build a count for each distinct word. That sounds like a use for a hash—we can index it with the word and use the corresponding entry to keep a count.

Let’s start with the method that splits a string into words:
```ruby
tut_containers/word_freq/words_from_string.rb
​ 	
​def​ words_from_string(string)​ 	
  string.downcase.scan(/[​\w​']+/)​ 	
​end​
```
This method uses two very useful string methods: ​downcase​ returns a lowercase version of a string, and ​scan​ returns an array of substrings that match a given pattern. In this case, the pattern is ​[\w’]+​, which matches sequences containing “word characters” and single quotes.

We can play with this method. Notice how the result is an array:
```ruby
p words_from_string(​"But I didn't inhale, he said (emphatically)"​)
```
Produces:
```ruby
["but", "i", "didn't", "inhale", "he", "said", "emphatically"]
```
Our next task is to calculate word frequencies. To do this, we’ll create a hash object indexed by the words in our list. Each entry in this hash stores the number of times that word occurred. Let’s say we already have read part of the list, and we have seen the word ​the​ already. Then we’d have a hash that contained this:
```ruby
{ ...,  ​"the"​ => 1, ... }
```
If the variable ​next_word​ contained the word ​the​, then incrementing the count is as simple as this:
```ruby
counts[next_word] += 1
```
We’d then end up with a hash containing the following:
```ruby
{ ...,  ​"the"​ => 2, ... }
```
Our only problem is what to do when we encounter a word for the first time. We’ll try to increment the entry for that word, but there won’t be one, so our program will fail. There are a number of solutions to this. One is to check to see whether the entry exists before doing the increment:
```ruby
​if​ counts.has_key?(next_word)​ 	
  counts[next_word] += 1​ 	
​else​​ 	
  counts[next_word] = 1​ 	
​end​
```
However, there’s a tidier way. If we create a hash object using ​Hash.new(0)​, the parameter, ​0​ in this case, will be used as the hash’s default value—it will be the value returned if you look up a key that isn’t yet in the hash. Using that, we can write our ​count_frequency​ method:
```ruby
tut_containers/word_freq/count_frequency.rb
​ 	
​def​ count_frequency(word_list)​ 	
  counts = Hash.new(0)​ 	
  ​for​ word ​in​ word_list​ 	
    counts[word] += 1​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  counts
​ 	
​end​
​ 	
p count_frequency([​"sparky"​, ​"the"​, ​"cat"​, ​"sat"​, ​"on"​, ​"the"​, ​"mat"​])
```
Produces:
```ruby
{"sparky"=>1, "the"=>2, "cat"=>1, "sat"=>1, "on"=>1, "mat"=>1}
```
One little job left. The hash containing the word frequencies is ordered based on the first time it sees each word. It would be better to display the results based on the frequencies of the words. We can do that using the hash’s ​sort_by​ method. When you use ​sort_by​ , you give it a block that tells the sort what to use when making comparisons. In our case, we’ll just use the count. The result of the sort is an array containing a set of two-element arrays, with each subarray corresponding to a key/entry pair in the original hash. This makes our whole program:
```ruby
require_relative ​"words_from_string.rb"​​ 	
require_relative ​"count_frequency.rb"​​ 	
​ 	
raw_text  = ​%{The problem breaks down into two parts. First, given some text​​ 	
​as a string, return a list of words. That sounds like an array. Then, build​​ 	
​a count for each distinct word. That sounds like a use for a hash---we can​​ 	
​index it with the word and use the corresponding entry to keep a count.}​​ 	
​ 	
word_list = words_from_string(raw_text)​ 	
counts    = count_frequency(word_list)​ 	
sorted    = counts.sort_by {|word, count| count}​ 	
top_five  = sorted.last(5)​ 	
​ 	
​for​ i ​in​ 0...5            ​# (this is ugly code--read on​​ 	
  word = top_five[i][0]   ​#  for a better version)​​ 	
  count = top_five[i][1]​ 	
  puts ​"​#{word}​:  ​#{count}​"​ 	
​end​
```
Produces:
```ruby
that:  2​ 	
sounds:  2​ 	
like:  2​ 	
the:  3​ 	
a:  6
```
At this point, a quick test may be in order. To do this, we’re going to use a testing framework called Test::Unit that comes with the standard Ruby distributions. We won’t describe it fully yet (we do that in Chapter 13, ​Unit Testing​). For now, we’ll just say that the method ​assert_equal​ checks that its two parameters are equal, complaining bitterly if they aren’t. We’ll use assertions to test our two methods, one method at a time. (That’s one reason why we wrote them as separate methods—it makes them testable in isolation.)

Here are some tests for the ​word_from_string​ method:
```ruby
require_relative ​'words_from_string'​​ 	
require ​'test/unit'​​ 	
​ 	
​class​ TestWordsFromString < Test::Unit::TestCase​ 	
  ​def​ test_empty_string​ 	
    assert_equal([], words_from_string(​""​))​ 	
    assert_equal([], words_from_string(​"     "​))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_single_word​ 	
    assert_equal([​"cat"​], words_from_string(​"cat"​))​ 	
    assert_equal([​"cat"​], words_from_string(​"  cat   "​))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_many_words​ 	
    assert_equal([​"the"​, ​"cat"​, ​"sat"​, ​"on"​, ​"the"​, ​"mat"​],​ 	
         words_from_string(​"the cat sat on the mat"​))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
​ 	​def​ test_ignores_punctuation​ 	
    assert_equal([​"the"​, ​"cat's"​, ​"mat"​],​ 	
         words_from_string(​"<the!> cat's, -mat-"​))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
​end​
```

```
The test starts by requiring the source file containing our ​words_from_string​ method, along with the unit test framework itself. It then defines a test class. Within that class, any methods whose names start with ​test​ are automatically run by the testing framework. The results show that four test methods ran, successfully executing six assertions.

We can also test that our count of word frequency works:
```ruby
require_relative ​'count_frequency'​​ 	
require ​'test/unit'​ 	
​ 	
​class​ TestCountFrequency < Test::Unit::TestCase​ 	
  ​def​ test_empty_list​ 	
    assert_equal({}, count_frequency([]))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_single_word​ 	
    assert_equal({​"cat"​ => 1}, count_frequency([​"cat"​]))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_two_different_words​ 	
    assert_equal({​"cat"​ => 1, ​"sat"​ => 1}, count_frequency([​"cat"​, ​"sat"​]))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_two_words_with_adjacent_repeat​ 	
    assert_equal({​"cat"​ => 2, ​"sat"​ => 1}, count_frequency([​"cat"​, ​"cat"​, ​"sat"​]))​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ test_two_words_with_non_adjacent_repeat​ 	
    assert_equal({​"cat"​ => 2, ​"sat"​ => 1},  count_frequency([​"cat"​, ​"sat"​, ​"cat"​]))​
