5.3 Mixins
====
Modules have another, wonderful use. At a stroke, they pretty much eliminate the need for inheritance, providing a facility called a ​ mixin​ .

In the previous section’s examples, we defined module methods, methods whose names were prefixed by the module name. If this made you think of class methods, your next thought may well be “What happens if I define instance methods within a module?” Good question. A module can’t have instances, because a module isn’t a class. However, you can ​ include​ a module within a class definition. When this happens, all the module’s instance methods are suddenly available as methods in the class as well. They get ​mixed in​. In fact, mixed-in modules effectively behave as superclasses.
```ruby
​module​ Debug​ 	
  ​def​ who_am_i?​ 	
    ​"​#{self.class.name}​ (id: ​#{self.object_id}​): ​#{self.name}​"​​ 	
  ​end​​ 	
​end​
​ 	​ 	
​class​ Phonograph​ 	
  include Debug​ 	
  attr_reader :name​ 	

  ​def​ initialize(name)​ 	
    @name = name​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​# ...​
​ 	
​end​​ 	
​ 	
​class​ EightTrack​ 	
  include Debug​ 	
  attr_reader :name
​ 	
  ​def​ initialize(name)​ 	
    @name = name​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​# ...​
​ 	
​end​
​
ph = Phonograph.new(​"West End Blues"​)​ 	
et = EightTrack.new(​"Surrealistic Pillow"​)​ 	
​ 	
ph.who_am_i?  ​# => "Phonograph (id: 70266478767560): West End Blues"​​ 	
et.who_am_i?  ​# => "EightTrack (id: 70266478767520): Surrealistic Pillow"​
```
By including the ​Debug​ module, both the ​Phonograph​ and ​EightTrack​ classes gain access to the ​who_am_i?​ instance method.

We’ll make a couple of points about the ​include​ statement before we go on.

First, it has nothing to do with files. C programmers use a preprocessor directive called ​#include​ to insert the contents of one file into another during compilation. The Ruby ​include​ statement simply makes a reference to a module. If that module is in a separate file, you must use ​require​ (or its less commonly used cousin, ​load​ ) to drag that file in before using ​include​. Second, a Ruby ​include​ does not simply copy the module’s instance methods into the class. Instead, it makes a reference from the class to the included module. If multiple classes include that module, they’ll all point to the same thing. If you change the definition of a method within a module, even while your program is running, all classes that include that module will exhibit the new behavior.[38]

Mixins give you a wonderfully controlled way of adding functionality to classes. However, their true power comes out when the code in the mixin starts to interact with code in the class that uses it. Let’s take the standard Ruby mixin ​Comparable​ as an example. The ​Comparable​ mixin adds the comparison operators (​<​, ​<=​, ​==​, ​>=​, and ​>​), as well as the method ​between?​ , to a class. For this to work, ​Comparable​ assumes that any class that uses it defines the operator ​<=>​. So, as a class writer, you define one method, ​<=>​; include ​Comparable​; and get six comparison functions for free.

Let’s try this with a simple ​Person​ class. We’ll make people comparable based on their names:
```ruby
​class​ Person​ 	
  include Comparable​ 	
  attr_reader :name​ 	
​ 	
  ​def​ initialize(name)​ 	
    @name = name​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ to_s​ 	
     ​"​#{@name}​"​​ 	
  ​end​
​ 	
  ​def​ <=>(other)​ 	
    self.name <=> other.name​ 	
  ​end​​ 	
​end​​ 	
​ 	
p1 = Person.new(​"Matz"​)​ 	
p2 = Person.new(​"Guido"​)​ 	
p3 = Person.new(​"Larry"​) 	
​ 	
​# Compare a couple of names​​ 	
​if​ p1 > p2​ 	
  puts ​"​#{p1.name}​'s name > ​#{p2.name}​'s name"​​ 	
​end​ 	
​ 	
​# Sort an array of Person objects​​ 	
puts ​"Sorted list:"​​ 	
puts [ p1, p2, p3].sort
```
Produces:
```ruby
Matz's name > Guido's name 	
Sorted list:​ 	
Guido​ 	
Larry​ 	
Matz
```
We included ​Comparable​ in our ​Person​ class and then defined a ​<=>​ method. We were then able to perform comparisons (such as ​p1 > p2​) and even sort an array of ​Person​ objects.


```ruby
                                Inheritance and Mixins
Some object-oriented languages (such as C++) support multiple inheritance, where a class can have more than one immediate parent, inheriting functionality from each. Although powerful, this technique can be dangerous, because the inheritance hierarchy can become ambiguous.

Other languages, such as Java and C#, support single inheritance. Here, a class can have only one immediate parent. Although cleaner (and easier to implement), single inheritance also has drawbacks—in the real world, objects often inherit attributes from multiple sources (a ball is both a ​bouncing thing​ and a ​spherical thing​, for example). Ruby offers an interesting and powerful compromise, giving you the simplicity of single inheritance and the power of multiple inheritance. A Ruby class has only one direct parent, so Ruby is a single-inheritance language. However, Ruby classes can include the functionality of any number of ​mixins​ (a mixin is like a partial class definition). This provides a controlled multiple-inheritance-like capability with none of the drawbacks.
