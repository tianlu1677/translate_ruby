Chapter 4
====
集合，语句块和迭代器(Containers, Blocks, and Iterators)
=====

Most real programs deal with collections of data: the people in a course, the songs in your playlist, the books in the store. Ruby comes with two built-in classes to handle these collections: arrays and hashes.[22] Mastery of these two classes is key to being an effective Ruby programmer. This mastery may take some time, because both classes have large interfaces.

But it isn’t just these classes that give Ruby its power when dealing with collections. Ruby also has a block syntax that lets you encapsulate chunks of code. When paired with collections, these blocks become powerful iterator constructs. In this chapter, we’ll look at the two collection classes as well as blocks and iterators.

大多数真实的程序是用来处理数据的集合: 教室里的人，歌单上的歌曲和书店里的书。Ruby中有两种内建(build-in)类来处理集合: 数组(arrays)和哈希(hashes)。掌握这两个类是称为高效率的Ruby程序员的关键。因为这两个类都有非常多的接口，掌握这些可能需要花费些时间。

但正是这两个类让Ruby能够高效的处理集合。Ruby也有一种语句块(block)的语法让你封装的一组代码。当语句块和集合配合使用时，组成了强大的迭代器结构。在这章中，我们将会介绍这两个集合类以及语句块(block)和迭代器(iterators)
