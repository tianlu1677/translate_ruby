7.3 Digging Deeper
=====
Like most things in Ruby, regular expressions are just objects—they are instances of the class ​Regexp​. This means you can assign them to variables, pass them to methods, and so on:
```ruby
str = ​"dog and cat"​​ 	
pattern = /nd/​ 	
pattern =~ str ​# => 5​ 	
str =~ pattern ​# => 5​
```
You can also create regular expression objects by calling the ​Regexp​ class’s ​new​ method or by using the ​`%r{...}​` syntax. The ​%r​ syntax is particularly useful when creating patterns that contain forward slashes:
```ruby
/mm​\/​dd/            ​# => /mm\/dd/​​ 	
Regexp.new(​"mm/dd"​) ​# => /mm\/dd/​​ 	
%r{mm/dd}           ​# => /mm\/dd/​
```

```ruby
															Playing with Regular Expressions
If you’re like us, you’ll sometimes get confused by regular expressions. You create something that ​should​ work, but it just doesn’t seem to match. That’s when we fall back to irb. We’ll cut and paste the regular expression into irb and then try to match it against strings. We’ll slowly remove portions until we get it to match the target string and add stuff back until it fails. At that point, we’ll know what we were doing wrong.
```
###Regular Expression Options
A regular expression may include one or more options that modify the way the pattern matches strings. If you’re using literals to create the ​Regexp​ object, then the options are one or more characters placed immediately after the terminator. If you’re using ​Regexp.new​ , the options are constants used as the second parameter of the constructor.
```ruby
​i​

​Case insensitive​. The pattern match will ignore the case of letters in the pattern and string. (The old technique of setting ​$=​ to make matches case insensitive no longer works.)

​o​

​Substitute once​. Any ​#{...}​ substitutions in a particular regular expression literal will be performed just once, the first time it is evaluated. Otherwise, the substitutions will be performed every time the literal generates a ​Regexp​ object.

​m​

​Multiline mode​. Normally, “.” matches any character except a newline. With the ​/m​ option, “.” matches any character.

​x​

​Extended mode​. Complex regular expressions can be difficult to read. The ​x​ option allows you to insert spaces and newlines in the pattern to make it more readable. You can also use ​#​ to introduce comments.
```
Another set of options allows you to set the language encoding of the regular expression. If none of these options is specified, the regular expression will have US-ASCII encoding if it contains only 7-bit characters. Otherwise, it will use the default encoding of the source file containing the literal: n: no encoding (ASCII), e: EUC, s: SJIS, and u: UTF-8.

###Matching Against Patterns
Once you have a regular expression object, you can match it against a string using the ​(Regexp#match(​​string​​)​ method or the match operators ​=~​ (positive match) and ​!~​ (negative match). The match operators are defined for both ​String​ and ​Regexp​ objects. One operand of the match operator must be a regular expression.
```ruby
name = ​"Fats Waller"​​ 	
name =~ /a/                   ​# => 1​​ 	
name =~ /z/                   ​# => nil​​ 	
/a/ =~ name                   ​# => 1​​ 	
/a/.match(name)               ​# => #<MatchData "a">​​ 	
Regexp.new(​"all"​).match(name) ​# => #<MatchData "all">​
```
The match operators return the character position at which the match occurred, while the ​match​ method returns a ​MatchData​ object. In all forms, if the match fails, ​nil​ is returned.

After a successful match, Ruby sets a whole bunch of magic variables. For example, ​$&​ receives the part of the string that was matched by the pattern, ​$‘​ receives the part of the string that preceded the match, and ​$’​ receives the string after the match. However, these particular variables are considered to be fairly ugly, so most Ruby programmers instead use the ​MatchData​ object returned from the ​match​ method, because it encapsulates all the information Ruby knows about the match. Given a ​MatchData​ object, you can call ​pre_match​ to return the part of the string before the match, ​post_match​ for the string after the match, and index using ​[0]​ to get the matched portion.

We can use these to write a ​show_regexp​ , a method that shows where a pattern matches:
```ruby
tut_regexp/show_match.rb
​ 	
​def​ show_regexp(string, pattern)​ 	
  match = pattern.match(string)​ 	
  ​if​ match​ 	
    ​"​#{match.pre_match}​->​#{match[0]}​<-​#{match.post_match}​"​​ 	
  ​else​​ 	
    ​"no match"​​ 	
  ​end​​ 	
​end​
```
We could use this method like this:
```ruby
show_regexp(​'very interesting'​, /t/) ​# => very in->t<-eresting​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Fats Waller'​, /lle/)    ​# => Fats Wa->lle<-r​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Fats Waller'​, /z/)      ​# => no match​
```
###Deeper Patterns
We said earlier that, within a pattern, all characters match themselves except` . | ( ) [ ] { } + \ ^ $ * and ?`. Let’s dig a bit deeper into this.

First, always remember that you need to escape any of these characters with a backslash if you want them to be treated as regular characters to match:
```ruby
show_regexp(​'yes | no'​, /​\|​/)       ​# => yes ->|<- no​​ 	
show_regexp(​'yes (no)'​, /​\(​no​\)​/)   ​# => yes ->(no)<-​​ 	
show_regexp(​'are you sure?'​, /e​\?​/) ​# => are you sur->e?<-
```
Now let’s see what some of these characters mean if you use them without escaping them.

###Anchors
By default, a regular expression will try to find the first match for the pattern in a string. Match ​/iss/​ against the string “Mississippi,” and it will find the substring “iss” starting at position 1 (the second character in the string). But what if you want to force a pattern to match only at the start or end of a string?

The patterns ​^​ and ​$​ match the beginning and end of a line, respectively. These are often used to ​ anchor​ a pattern match; for example, ​/^option/​ matches the word ​option​ only if it appears at the start of a line. Similarly, the sequence ​\A​ matches the beginning of a string, and ​\z​ and ​\Z​ match the end of a string. (Actually, ​\Z​ matches the end of a string ​unless​ the string ends with ​\n​, in which case it matches just before the ​\n​.)
```ruby
str = ​"this is\nthe time"​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /^the/)   ​# => this is\n->the<- time​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /is$/)    ​# => this ->is<-\nthe time​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /​\A​this/) ​# => ->this<- is\nthe time​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /​\A​the/)  ​# => no match​
```
Similarly, the patterns ​\b​ and ​\B​ match word boundaries and nonword boundaries, respectively. Word characters are ASCII letters, numbers, and underscores:
```ruby
show_regexp(​"this is\nthe time"​, /​\b​is/) ​# => this ->is<-\nthe time​​ 	
show_regexp(​"this is\nthe time"​, /​\B​is/) ​# => th->is<- is\nthe time​
```
###Character Classes
A ​ character class​ is a set of characters between brackets: ​[​​characters​​]​ matches any single character between the brackets, so ​[aeiou]​ matches a vowel, ​[,.:;!?]​ matches some punctuation, and so on. The significance of the special regular expression characters—​.|(){+^$*?​—is turned off inside the brackets. However, normal string substitution still occurs, so (for example) ​\b​ represents a backspace character, and ​\n​ represents a newline (see Table 11, ​Substitutions in double-quoted strings​). In addition, you can use the abbreviations shown in Table 2, ​Character class abbreviations​, so that ​\s​ matches any whitespace character, not just a literal space:
```ruby
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[aeiou]/) ​# => Pr->i<-ce $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[​\s​]/)    ​# => Price-> <-$12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[$.]/)    ​# => Price ->$<-12.​
```
Within the brackets, the sequence c1-c2 represents all the characters from c1 to c2 in the current encoding:
```ruby
a = ​'see [The PickAxe-page 123]'​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[A-F]/)      ​# => see [The Pick->A<-xe-page 123]​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[A-Fa-f]/)   ​# => s->e<-e [The PickAxe-page 123]​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[0-9]/)      ​# => see [The PickAxe-page ->1<-23]​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[0-9][0-9]/) ​# => see [The PickAxe-page ->12<-3]​
```
You can negate a character class by putting an up arrow (​^​, sometimes called a ​caret​) immediately after the opening bracket:
```ruby
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[^A-Z]/)      ​# => P->r<-ice $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[^​\w​]/)       ​# => Price-> <-$12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[a-z][^a-z]/) ​# => Pric->e <-$12.​
```
Some character classes are used so frequently that Ruby provides abbreviations for them. These abbreviations are listed in Table 2, ​Character class abbreviations​—they may be used both within brackets and in the body of a pattern.
```ruby
show_regexp(​'It costs $12.'​, /​\s​/) ​# => It-> <-costs $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'It costs $12.'​, /​\d​/) ​# => It costs $->1<-2.​
```
If you look at the table, you’ll see that some of the character classes have different interpretations depending on the character set option defined for the regular expression. Basically, these options tell the regexp engine whether (for example) word characters are just the ASCII alphanumerics, or whether they should be extended to include Unicode letters, marks, numbers, and connection punctuation. The options are set using the sequence ​(?​option​)​, where the option is one of ​d​ (for Ruby 1.9 behavior), ​a​ for ASCII-only support, and ​u​ for full Unicode support. If you don’t specify an option, it defaults to ​(?d)​.«2.0»
```ruby
show_regexp(​'über.'​, /(?a)​\w​+/) ​# => ü->ber<-.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'über.'​, /(?d)​\w​+/) ​# => ü->ber<-.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'über.'​, /(?u)​\w​+/) ​# => ->über<-.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'über.'​, /(?d)​\W​+/) ​# => ->ü<-ber.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'über.'​, /(?u)​\W​+/) ​# => über->.<-​
```
The POSIX character classes, as shown in Table 3, ​Posix character classes​, correspond to the ctype(3) macros of the same names. They can also be negated by putting an up arrow (or caret) after the first colon:
```ruby
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[aeiou]/)          ​# => Pr->i<-ce $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[[:digit:]]/)      ​# => Price $->1<-2.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[[:space:]]/)      ​# => Price-> <-$12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[[:^alpha:]]/)     ​# => Price-> <-$12.​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Price $12.'​, /[[:punct:]aeiou]/) ​# => Pr->i<-ce $12.​
```
If you want to include the literal characters ​]​ and ​-​ in a character class, escape them with \:
```ruby
a = ​'see [The PickAxe-page 123]'​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[​\]​]/)    ​# => see [The PickAxe-page 123->]<-​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[0-9​\]​]/) ​# => see [The PickAxe-page ->1<-23]​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[​\d\-​]/)  ​# => see [The PickAxe->-<-page 123]​
```
You can create the intersection of character classes using ​&&​. So, to match all lowercase ASCII letters that aren’t vowels, you could use this:
```ruby
str = ​"now is the time"​​ 	
str.gsub(/[a-z&&[^aeiou]]/, ​'*'​) ​# => "*o* i* **e *i*e"​
```
The ​\p​ construct gives you an encoding-aware way of matching a character with a particular Unicode property (shown in Table 4, ​Unicode character properties​):
```ruby
​# encoding: utf-8​​ 	
string = ​"∂y/∂x = 2πx"​​ 	
show_regexp(string, /​\p​{Alnum}/) ​# => ∂->y<-/∂x = 2πx​
​ 	
show_regexp(string, /​\p​{Digit}/) ​# => ∂y/∂x = ->2<-πx​
​ 	
show_regexp(string, /​\p​{Space}/) ​# => ∂y/∂x-> <-= 2πx​
​ 	
show_regexp(string, /​\p​{Greek}/) ​# => ∂y/∂x = 2->π<-x​
​ 	
show_regexp(string, /​\p​{Graph}/) ​# => ->∂<-y/∂x = 2πx​
```
Finally, a period (.) appearing outside brackets represents any character except a newline (though in multiline mode it matches a newline, too):
```ruby
a = ​'It costs $12.'​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /c.s/) ​# => It ->cos<-ts $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /./)   ​# => ->I<-t costs $12.​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /​\.​/)  ​# => It costs $12->.<-​
```
```ruby
												Table 2. Character class abbreviations
For some of these classes, the meaning depends on the character set mode selected for the pattern. In these cases, the dfferent options are shown like this:

​(?a)​, ​(?d)​ → ​[a-zA-Z0-9_]​
​(?u)​ → ​Letter, Mark, Number, Connector_Punctuation​

In this case, the first line applies to ASCII and default modes, and the second to unicode. In the second part of each line, the ​[…]​ is a conventional character class. Words in italic are Unicode character classes.

​\X​             An extended Unicode grapheme (two or more characters 
               that combine to form a single visual character).«2.0»
```
###Repetition
When we specified the pattern that split the song list line, ​/\s*\|\s*/​, we said we wanted to match a vertical bar surrounded by an arbitrary amount of whitespace. We now know that the ​\s​ sequences match a single whitespace character and ​\|​ means a literal vertical bar, so it seems likely that the asterisks somehow mean “an arbitrary amount.” In fact, the asterisk is one of a number of modifiers that allow you to match multiple occurrences of a pattern.

If ​r​ stands for the immediately preceding regular expression within a pattern, then
```ruby
​r​​*​        Matches zero or more occurrences of ​r​
​r​​+​        Matches one or more occurrences of ​r​
​r​​?​        Matches zero or one occurrence of ​r​
​r​​{m,n}    Matches at least m and at most n occurrences of ​r​
​r​​{m,}     Matches at least m occurrences of ​r​
​r​​{,n}     Matches at most n occurrences of ​r​
​r​​{m}      Matches exactly m occurrences of ​r​
```
These repetition constructs have a high precedence—they bind only to the immediately preceding matching construct in the pattern. ​/ab+/​ matches an ​a​ followed by one or more ​b​’s, not a sequence of ​ab​’s.

These patterns are called ​ greedy​ , because by default they will match as much of the string as they can. You can alter this behavior and have them match the minimum by adding a question mark suffix. The repetition is then called ​ lazy​ —it stops once it has done the minimum amount of work required.
```ruby
a = ​"The moon is made of cheese"​
​ 	
show_regexp(a, /​\w​+/)           ​# => ->The<- moon is made of cheese​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /​\s​.*​\s​/)        ​# => The-> moon is made of <-cheese​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /​\s​.*?​\s​/)       ​# => The-> moon <-is made of cheese​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /[aeiou]{2,99}/) ​# => The m->oo<-n is made of cheese​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /mo?o/)          ​# => The ->moo<-n is made of cheese​​ 	
​# here's the lazy version​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /mo??o/)         ​# => The ->mo<-on is made of cheese​
```
(There’s an additional modifier, ​+​, that makes them greedy and also stops backtracking, but that will have to wait until the advanced section of the chapter.)

Be very careful when using the ​*​ modifier. It matches zero or more occurrences. We often forget about the zero part. In particular, a pattern that contains just a ​*​ repetition will always match, whatever string you pass it. For example, the pattern ​/a*/​ will always match, because every string contains zero or more a’s.
```ruby
a = ​"The moon is made of cheese"​​ 	
​# both of these match an empty substring at the start of the string​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /m*/) ​# => -><-The moon is made of cheese​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /Z*/) ​# => -><-The moon is made of cheese​
```
###Alternation
We know that the vertical bar is special, because our line-splitting pattern had to escape it with a backslash. That’s because an unescaped vertical bar, as in ​|​, matches either the construct that precedes it or the construct that follows it:
```ruby
a = ​"red ball blue sky"​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /d|e/)                ​# => r->e<-d ball blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /al|lu/)              ​# => red b->al<-l blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /red ball|angry sky/) ​# => ->red ball<- blue sky​
```
There’s a trap for the unwary here, because ​|​ has a very low precedence. The last example in the previous lines matches ​red ball​ or ​angry sky​, not ​red ball sky​ or ​red angry sky​. To match ​red ball sky​ or ​red angry sky​, you’d need to override the default precedence using grouping.

###Grouping
You can use parentheses to group terms within a regular expression. Everything within the group is treated as a single regular expression.
```ruby
​# This matches an 'a' followed by one or more 'n's​​ 	
show_regexp(​'banana'​, /an+/)   ​# => b->an<-ana​​ 	
​# This matches the sequence 'an' one or more times​​ 	
show_regexp(​'banana'​, /(an)+/) ​# => b->anan<-a​​ 	
a = ​'red ball blue sky'​
​ 	
show_regexp(a, /blue|red/)             ​# => ->red<- ball blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /(blue|red) ​\w​+/)       ​# => ->red ball<- blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /(red|blue) ​\w​+/)       ​# => ->red ball<- blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /red|blue ​\w​+/)         ​# => ->red<- ball blue sky​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /red (ball|angry) sky/) ​# => no match​​ 	
a = ​'the red angry sky'​​ 	
show_regexp(a, /red (ball|angry) sky/) ​# => the ->red angry sky<-​
```
Parentheses also collect the results of pattern matching. Ruby counts opening parentheses and for each stores the result of the partial match between it and the corresponding closing parenthesis. You can use this partial match both within the rest of the pattern and in your Ruby program. Within the pattern, the sequence ​\1​ refers to the match of the first group, ​\2​ the second group, and so on. Outside the pattern, the special variables ​$1​, ​$2​, and so on, serve the same purpose.
```ruby
/(​\d\d​):(​\d\d​)(..)/ =~ ​"12:50am"​   ​# => 0​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#$1​, minute ​#$2​"​          ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​​ 	
/((​\d\d​):(​\d\d​))(..)/ =~ ​"12:50am"​ ​# => 0​​ 	
​"Time is ​#$1​"​                      ​# => "Time is 12:50"​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#$2​, minute ​#$3​"​          ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​​ 	
​"AM/PM is ​#$4​"​                     ​# => "AM/PM is am"​
```
If you’re using the ​MatchData​ object returned by the ​match​ method, you can index into it to get the corresponding subpatterns:
```ruby
md = /(​\d\d​):(​\d\d​)(..)/.match(​"12:50am"​)​ 	
​"Hour is ​#{md[1]}​, minute ​#{md[2]}​"​ ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​​ 	
md = /((​\d\d​):(​\d\d​))(..)/.match(​"12:50am"​)​ 	
​"Time is ​#{md[1]}​"​                  ​# => "Time is 12:50"​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#{md[2]}​, minute ​#{md[3]}​"​ ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​​ 	
​"AM/PM is ​#{md[4]}​"​                 ​# => "AM/PM is am"​
```
The ability to use part of the current match later in that match allows you to look for various forms of repetition:
```ruby
​# match duplicated letter​​ 	
show_regexp(​'He said "Hello"'​, /(​\w​)​\1​/) ​# => He said "He->ll<-o"​​ 	
​# match duplicated substrings​​ 	
show_regexp(​'Mississippi'​, /(​\w​+)​\1​/)    ​# => M->ississ<-ippi​
```
Rather than use numbers, you can also use names to refer to previously matched content. You give a group a name by placing ​?<​name​>​ immediately after the opening parenthesis. You can subsequently refer to this named group using ​\k<​name​>​ (or ​\k’​name​’​).
```ruby
​# match duplicated letter​​ 	
str = ​'He said "Hello"'​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /(?<char>​\w​)​\k​<char>/) ​# => He said "He->ll<-o"​​ 	​ 	
​# match duplicated adjacent substrings​​ 	
str = ​'Mississippi'​​ 	
show_regexp(str, /(?<seq>​\w​+)​\k​<seq>/)  ​# => M->ississ<-ippi​

```
The named matches in a regular expression are also available as local variables, but only if you use a literal regexp and that literal appears on the left hand side of the ​=~​ operator. (So you can’t assign a regular expression object to a variable, match the contents of that variable against a string, and expect the local variables to be set.)
```ruby
/(?<hour>​\d\d​):(?<min>​\d\d​)(..)/ =~ ​"12:50am"​ ​# => 0​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#{hour}​, minute ​#{min}​"​              ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​	
​ 	
​# You can mix named and position-based references​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#{hour}​, minute ​#{$2}​"​               ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​​ 	
​"Hour is ​#{$1}​, minute ​#{min}​"​                ​# => "Hour is 12, minute 50"​
```
###Pattern-Based Substitution
We’ve already seen how ​sub​ and ​gsub​ replace the matched part of a string with other text. In those previous examples, the pattern was always fixed text, but the substitution methods work equally well if the pattern contains repetition, alternation, and grouping.
```ruby
a = ​"quick brown fox"​​ 	
a.sub(/[aeiou]/,  ​'*'​) ​# => "q*ick brown fox"​​ 	
a.gsub(/[aeiou]/, ​'*'​) ​# => "q**ck br*wn f*x"​​ 	
a.sub(/​\s\S​+/,  ​''​)    ​# => "quick fox"​​ 	
a.gsub(/​\s\S​+/, ​''​)    ​# => "quick"​
```
The substitution methods can take a string or a block. If a block is used, it is passed the matching substring, and the block’s value is substituted into the original string.
```ruby
a = ​"quick brown fox"​​ 	
a.sub(/^./) {|match| match.upcase }       ​# => "Quick brown fox"​​ 	
a.gsub(/[aeiou]/) {|vowel| vowel.upcase } ​# => "qUIck brOwn fOx"​
```
Maybe we want to normalize names entered by users into a web application. They may enter DAVE THOMAS, dave thomas, or dAvE tHoMas, and we’d like to store it as Dave Thomas. The following method is a simple first iteration. The pattern that matches the first character of a word is ​\b\w​—look for a word boundary followed by a word character. Combine this with ​gsub​ , and we can hack the names:
```ruby
​def​ mixed_case(name)​ 	
  name.downcase.gsub(/​\b\w​/) {|first| first.upcase }​ 	
​end​
​ 	
mixed_case(​"DAVE THOMAS"​) ​# => "Dave Thomas"​​ 	
mixed_case(​"dave thomas"​) ​# => "Dave Thomas"​​ 	
mixed_case(​"dAvE tHoMas"​) ​# => "Dave Thomas"​
```
There’s an idiomatic way to write the substitution in Ruby 1.9, but we’ll have to wait until ​The Symbol.to_proc Trick​ to see why it works:
```ruby
​def​ mixed_case(name)​ 	
  name.downcase.gsub(/​\b\w​/, &:upcase)​ 	
​end​
​ 	​ 	
mixed_case(​"dAvE tHoMas"​) ​# => "Dave Thomas"​
```
You can also give ​sub​ and ​gsub​ a hash as the replacement parameter, in which case they will look up matched groups and use the corresponding values as replacement text:
```ruby
replacement = { ​"cat"​ => ​"feline"​, ​"dog"​ => ​"canine"​ }​ 	
replacement.default = ​"unknown"​​ 	
​ 	
​"cat and dog"​.gsub(/​\w​+/, replacement) ​# => "feline unknown canine"​
```
###Backslash Sequences in the Substitution
Earlier we noted that the sequences ​\1​, ​\2​, and so on, are available in the pattern, standing for the ​n​th group matched so far. The same sequences can be used in the second argument of ​sub​ and ​gsub​ .
```ruby
puts ​"fred:smith"​.sub(/(​\w​+):(​\w​+)/, ​'\2, \1'​)​ 	
puts ​"nercpyitno"​.gsub(/(.)(.)/, ​'\2\1'​)
```
Produces:
```ruby
smith, fred​ 	
encryption
```
You can also reference named groups:
```ruby
puts ​"fred:smith"​.sub(/(?<first>​\w​+):(?<last>​\w​+)/, ​'\k<last>, \k<first>'​)​ 	
puts ​"nercpyitno"​.gsub(/(?<c1>.)(?<c2>.)/, ​'\k<c2>\k<c1>'​)
```
Produces:
```ruby
smith, fred​ 	
encryption
```
Additional backslash sequences work in substitution strings: ​\&​ (last match), ​\+​ (last matched group), ​\‘​ (string prior to match), ​\’​ (string after match), and ​\\​ (a literal backslash).

It gets confusing if you want to include a literal backslash in a substitution. The obvious thing to write is ​str.gsub(/\\/, ’\\\\’)​.

Clearly, this code is trying to replace each backslash in ​str​ with two. The programmer doubled up the backslashes in the replacement text, knowing that they’d be converted to ​\\​ in syntax analysis. However, when the substitution occurs, the regular expression engine performs another pass through the string, converting ​\\​ to ​\​, so the net effect is to replace each single backslash with another single backslash. You need to write ​gsub(/\\/, ’\\\\\\\\\’​)!
```ruby
str = ​'a\b\c'​              ​# => "a\b\c"​​ 	
str.gsub(/​\\​/, ​'\\\\\\\\'​) ​# => "a\\b\\c"​
```
However, using the fact that ​\&​ is replaced by the matched string, you could also write this:
```ruby
str = ​'a\b\c'​          ​# => "a\b\c"​​ 	
str.gsub(/​\\​/, ​'\&\&'​) ​# => "a\\b\\c"
```
If you use the block form of ​gsub​ , the string for substitution is analyzed only once (during the syntax pass), and the result is what you intended:

```ruby
str = ​'a\b\c'​             ​# => "a\b\c"​​ 	
str.gsub(/​\\​/) { ​'\\\\'​ } ​# => "a\\b\\c"
```
At the start of this chapter, we said that it contained two emergency exits. The first was after we discussed basic matching and substitution. This is the second: you now know as much about regular expressions as the vast majority of Ruby developers. Feel free to break away and move on to the next chapter. But if you’re feeling brave....
