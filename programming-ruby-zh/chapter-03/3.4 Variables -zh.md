3.4 变量(Variables)
====
Now that we’ve gone to the trouble to create all these objects, let’s make sure we don’t lose them. Variables are used to keep track of objects; each variable holds a reference to an object. Let’s confirm this with some code:

现在我们已经不辞辛苦的创建了所有这些对象，确保我们没有丢失。变量是用来保存对象的联系，一个变量保存一个对象的引用的。我们通过代码来验证:
```ruby
person = ​"Tim"​ 	
puts ​"The object in 'person' is a ​#{person.class}​"​​ 	
puts ​"The object has an id of ​#{person.object_id}​"​​ 	
puts ​"and a value of '​#{person}​'"​
```
Produces:
```ruby
The object in 'person' is a String​ 	
The object has an id of 70230663692980​ 	
and a value of 'Tim'
```
On the first line, Ruby creates a new string object with the value ​Tim​. A reference to this object is placed in the local variable ​person​. A quick check shows that the variable has indeed taken on the personality of a string, with an object ID, a class, and a value.

第一行，Ruby创建了一个值为`Tim`的字符串对象。这个对象的引用保存在局部变量`person`中。接下去的快速检查显示了，变量`person`具有字符串的特性——对象ID，类和值。

那么，变量是对象吗？在Ruby中，回答是"不"！变量只是对象的引用，对象漂浮在一个很大的水中的某处(大多数时候在堆(heap)中)，又变量指向对象。让我么看一个稍微复杂的例子：

So, is a variable an object? In Ruby, the answer is “no.” A variable is simply a reference to an object. Objects float around in a big pool somewhere (the heap, most of the time) and are pointed to by variables. Let’s make the example slightly more complicated:

```ruby
person1 = ​"Tim"​​ 	
person2 = person1​ 	
person1[0] = ​'J'​​ 	
​ 	
puts ​"person1 is ​#{person1}​"​​ 	
puts ​"person2 is ​#{person2}​"​
```
Produces:
```ruby
person1 is Jim​ 	
person2 is Jim
```
What happened here? We changed the first character of ​person1​ (Ruby strings are mutable, unlike Java), but both ​person1​ and ​person2​ changed from ​Tim​ to ​Jim​.

It all comes back to the fact that variables hold references to objects, not the objects themselves. Assigning ​person1​ to ​person2​ doesn’t create any new objects; it simply copies ​person1​’s object reference to ​person2​ so that both ​person1​ and ​person2​ refer to the same object.


Assignment ​ aliases​ objects, potentially giving you multiple variables that reference the same object. But can’t this cause problems in your code? It can, but not as often as you’d think (objects in Java, for example, work exactly the same way). In the previous example, for instance, you could avoid aliasing by using the ​dup​ method of ​String​, which creates a new string object with identical contents:

这里发生了什么？我们修改了`person1`的首字符(Ruby中的字符串是可变的，与Java不同)，但是`person1`和`person2`中的值由`Tim`变成了`Jim`。

对根到底，变量只是保存了对象的引用，而不是对象本身。把`person1`赋值给`person2`不会创建新的对象，而是仅仅把复制了person1的对象引用给person2.所以person1和person2都指向同一个对象。

分配对象别名(Assignment aliases objects)可能会让你多个变量指向同一个对象。这不会在你的代码中出问题吗？会出问题，但不是你想象的那么频繁(例如在Java中的对象，也是以同样的方式运行。)例如，在之前的例子中，你可以使用String中`dup`方法来避免创建别名，它会创建具有相同内容的新的String对象。
```ruby
person1 = ​"Tim"​​ 	
person2 = person1.dup​ 	
person1[0] = ​"J"​​ 	
puts ​"person1 is ​#{person1}​"​​ 	
puts ​"person2 is ​#{person2}​"​
```
Produces:
```ruby
person1 is Jim​ 	
person2 is Tim
```
You can also prevent anyone from changing a particular object by freezing it. Attempt to alter a frozen object, and Ruby will raise a ​RuntimeError​ exception:

为乐防止别人修改特定的对象，你也可以冻结(freeze)它。试图修改一个冻结的对象(frozen object)，Ruby会引发一个运行时异常(RuntimeError​ exception)。

```ruby
person1 = ​"Tim"​​ 	
person2 = person1​ 	
person1.freeze       ​# prevent modifications to the object​
person2[0] = ​"J"​
```
Produces:
```ruby
        from prog.rb:4:in `<main>'
​ 	
prog.rb:4:in `[]=': can't modify frozen String (RuntimeError)
```
There’s more to say about classes and objects in Ruby. We still have to look at class methods and at concepts such as mixins and inheritance. We’ll do that in Chapter 5, ​Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins​. But, for now, know that everything you manipulate in Ruby is an object and that objects start life as instances of classes. And one of the most common things we do with objects is create collections of them. But that’s the subject of our next chapter.

这里我们详谈介绍了Ruby中的类和对象。我们仍会在mixin和继承(inheritance)章节谈论类方法。在第五章，我们将会介绍共享功能(Sharing Functionality): 继承(Inheritance)、模块(Modules)以及混成(Mixins,以后翻译会用mixin，保持原汁原味)。对现在来说，你明白在Ruby中你操作的一切都是对象，对象是从类的实例开始存在的。我们最常用使用对象的事情是，创建对象的集合。这是我们在下一章的主题。

Yes, we know. We shouldn’t be holding prices in inexact old floats. Ruby has classes that hold fixed-point values exactly, but we want to look at classes, not arithmetic, in this section.

We multiply the floating-point price by 100 to get the price in cents but then add 0.5 before converting to an integer. Why? Because floating-point numbers don’t always have an exact internal representation. When we multiply 33.8 by 100, we get 3379.99999999999954525265. The ​Integer​ method would truncate this to 3379. Adding 0.5 before calling ​Integer​ rounds up the floating-point value, ensuring we get the best integer representation. This is a good example of why you want to use ​BigDecimal​, not ​Float​, in financial calculations.

If you encounter an error along the lines of "‘Float’: can’t convert nil into Float (TypeError)" when you run this code, you likely have extra spaces at the end of the header line in your CSV data file. The CSV library is pretty strict about the formats it accepts.
