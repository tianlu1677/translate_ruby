2.4 Symbols
====
Often, when programming, you need to create a name for something significant. For example, you might want to refer to the compass points by name, so you’d write this:
```ruby 	
NORTH = 1
EAST  = 2​ 	
SOUTH = 3​ 	
WEST  = 4
```
Then, in the rest of your code, you could use the constants instead of the numbers:
```ruby 	
walk(NORTH)​ 	
look(EAST)
```
Most of the time, the actual numeric values of these constants are irrelevant (as long as they are unique). All you want to do is differentiate the four directions.

Ruby offers a cleaner alternative. ​Symbols​ are simply constant names that you don’t have to predeclare and that are guaranteed to be unique. A symbol literal starts with a colon and is normally followed by some kind of name:
```ruby​ 	
walk(:north)​ 	
look(:east)
```
There’s no need to assign some kind of value to a symbol—Ruby takes care of that for you. Ruby also guarantees that no matter where it appears in your program, a particular symbol will have the same value. That is, you can write the following:
```ruby
​def​ walk(direction)
  ​if​ direction == :north​ 	
    ​# ...​​ 	
  ​end​​ 	
​end​
```
Symbols are frequently used as keys in hashes. We could write our previous example as this:
```ruby​ 	
inst_section = {​ 	
  :cello     => ​'string'​,​ 	
  :clarinet  => ​'woodwind'​,​ 	
  :drum      => ​'percussion'​,​ 	
  :oboe      => ​'woodwind'​,​ 	
  :trumpet   => ​'brass'​,​ 	
  :violin    => ​'string'​​ 	
}
​ 	
inst_section[:oboe]    ​# => "woodwind"​​ 	
inst_section[:cello]   ​# => "string"​​ 	

​# Note that strings aren't the same as symbols...​​ 	
inst_section[​'cello'​]  ​# => nil​
```
In fact, symbols are so frequently used as hash keys that Ruby has a shortcut syntax: you can use ​name: value​ pairs to create a hash if the keys are symbols:
```ruby​ 	
inst_section = {​ 	
  cello:    ​'string'​,​ 	
  clarinet: ​'woodwind'​,​ 	
  drum:     ​'percussion'​,​ 	
  oboe:     ​'woodwind'​,​ 	
  trumpet:  ​'brass'​,​ 	
  violin:   ​'string'​​ 	
}
​ 	
puts ​"An oboe is a ​#{inst_section[:oboe]}​ instrument"​
```
Produces:
```ruby
An oboe is a woodwind instrument
```
