2.10 Onward and Upward
====

That’s it. We’ve finished our lightning-fast tour of some of the basic features of Ruby. We took a look at objects, methods, strings, containers, and regular expressions; saw some simple control structures; and looked at some rather nifty iterators. We hope this chapter has given you enough ammunition to be able to attack the rest of this book.

It’s time to move on and move up—up to a higher level. Next, we’ll be looking at classes and objects, things that are at the same time both the highest-level constructs in Ruby and the essential underpinnings of the entire language.

Footnotes

This idea of expressing method calls in the form of messages comes from Smalltalk.

If your source files use non-ASCII characters (for example, because they’re written in UTF-8 encoding), all non-ASCII characters are assumed to be lowercase letters.

Although we talk about global and class variables here for completeness, you’ll find they are rarely used in Ruby programs. There’s a lot of evidence that global variables make programs harder to maintain. Class variables are not as dangerous—it’s just that people tend not to use them much.

Some people like to think of the association of a block with a method as a kind of argument passing. This works on one level, but it isn’t really the whole story. You may be better off thinking of the block and the method as coroutines, which transfer control back and forth between themselves.
