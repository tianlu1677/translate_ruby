7.1 What Regular Expressions Let You Do
=====
A regular expression is a pattern that can be matched against a string. It can be a simple pattern, such as ​the string must contain the sequence of letters “cat”​, or the pattern can be complex, such as ​the string must start with a protocol identifier, followed by two literal forward slashes, followed by...​, and so on. This is cool in theory. But what makes regular expressions so powerful is what you can do with them in practice:

1.You can test a string to see whether it matches a pattern.

2.You can extract from a string the sections that match all or part of a pattern.

3.You can change the string, replacing parts that match a pattern.

Ruby provides built-in support that makes pattern matching and substitution convenient and concise. In this section, we’ll work through the basics of regular expression patterns and see how Ruby supports matching and replacing based on those patterns. In the sections that follow, we’ll dig deeper into both the patterns and Ruby’s support for them.
