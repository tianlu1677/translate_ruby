2.7 Block块和迭代器 （Blocks and Iterators）
====
本节会简单的介绍Ruby的一个独特优势。代码块(code blocks​)就像参数一样，一种能和方法调用相关联的代码片段，是一种难以置信的强大特性。一个评论家说：“code blocks 非常有趣和重要，如果你之前没有关注，那么现在你就应该重视起来了。” 我们举双手赞同。

你可以用代码块(code blocks)来实现函数回调(但它比Java的anonymous inner classes更简单)、传递一组代码(但它比C的函数指针更灵活)以及实现迭代。
代码块(code blocks)是在 花括号或者 do ... end 之间的一组代码。下面就是代码块。
This section briefly describes one of Ruby’s particular strengths. We’re about to look at ​ code blocks​ , which are chunks of code you can associate with method invocations, almost as if they were parameters. This is an incredibly powerful feature. One of our reviewers commented at this point: “This is pretty interesting and important, so if you weren’t paying attention before, you should probably start now.” We’d have to agree.

You can use code blocks to implement callbacks (but they’re simpler than Java’s anonymous inner classes), to pass around chunks of code (but they’re more flexible than C’s function pointers), and to implement iterators.

Code blocks are just chunks of code between braces or between ​do​ and ​end​. This is a code block:
```ruby
{ puts ​"Hello"​ }
```
This is also a code block:
```
​do​​	
  club.enroll(person)​ 	
  person.socialize​ 	
​end​
```
为什么会有两种写法？部分原因是有人觉得一种写法比另外一种写法更自然。另外原因是两者有不同的优先级：花括号比do/end有更高的优先级。在本书中，我们尽量遵守Ruby的标准，单行的代码块用花括号，多行的代码块用do/end。

你所要做的就是把 block 和方法的调用关联起来。你把block放在方法调用行的结尾处，就可以实现方法调用了。比如，下面的代码，含有 `puts "Hi"`的
block与方法greet的调用关联起来。
Why are there two kinds of delimiter? It’s partly because sometimes one feels more natural to write than another. It’s partly too because they have different precedences: the braces bind more tightly than the ​do​/​end​ pairs. In this book, we try to follow what is becoming a Ruby standard and use braces for single-line blocks and ​do​/​end​ for multiline blocks.

All you can do with a block is associate it with a call to a method. You do this by putting the start of the block at the end of the source line containing the method call.

For example, in the following code, the block containing ​puts "Hi"​ is associated with the call to the method ​greet​ (which we don’t show):
```ruby
greet  { puts ​"Hi"​ }
```
If the method has parameters, they appear before the block:
```ruby
verbose_greet(​"Dave"​, ​"loyal customer"​)  { puts ​"Hi"​ }
```
A method can then invoke an associated block one or more times using the Ruby ​yield​ statement. You can think of ​yield​ as being something like a method call that invokes the block associated with the call to the method containing the ​yield​.

The following example shows this in action. We define a method that calls ​yield​ twice. We then call this method, putting a block on the same line, after the call (and after any arguments to the method).[18]
```ruby
​def​ call_block​ 	
  puts ​"Start of method"​​ 	
  ​yield​​ 	
  ​yield​​ 	
  puts ​"End of method"​​ 	
​end​​ 	
​ 	
call_block { puts ​"In the block"​ }
```
Produces:
```ruby
Start of method​ 	
In the block​ 	
In the block​ 	
End of method
```
The code in the block (​puts "In the block"​) is executed twice, once for each call to ​yield​.

You can provide arguments to the call to ​yield​, and they will be passed to the block. Within the block, you list the names of the parameters to receive these arguments between vertical bars (​|params...|​). The following example shows a method calling its associated block twice, passing the block two arguments each time:
```ruby
​def​ who_says_what​ 	
  ​yield​(​"Dave"​, ​"hello"​)​ 	
  ​yield​(​"Andy"​, ​"goodbye"​)​ 	
​end​ 	
who_says_what {|person, phrase| puts ​"​#{person}​ says ​#{phrase}​"​}
```
Produces:
```ruby
Dave says hello
Andy says goodbye
```
Code blocks are used throughout the Ruby library to implement ​ iterators​ , which are methods that return successive elements from some kind of collection, such as an array:
```ruby
animals = ​%w( ant bee cat dog )​    ​# create an array​
animals.each {|animal| puts animal }   ​# iterate over the contents​
```
Produces:
```ruby	
ant
bee
cat​ 	
dog
```
Many of the looping constructs that are built into languages such as C and Java are simply method calls in Ruby, with the methods invoking the associated block zero or more times:
```ruby
[ ​'cat'​, ​'dog'​, ​'horse'​ ].each {|name| print name, ​" "​ }​ 	
5.times {  print ​"*"​ }​ 	
3.upto(6) {|i|  print i }​ 	
(​'a'​..​'e'​).each {|char| print char }​ 	
puts
```
Produces:
```ruby
cat dog horse *****3456abcde
```
Here we ask an array to call the block once for each of its elements. Then, object 5 calls a block five times. Rather than use ​for​ loops, in Ruby we can ask the number 3 to call a block, passing in successive values until it reaches 6. Finally, the range of characters from ​a​ to ​e​ invokes a block using the method ​`each`​.
