2.9 Command-Line Arguments
====
When you run a Ruby program from the command line, you can pass in arguments. These are accessible in two different ways.

First, the array ​ARGV​ contains each of the arguments passed to the running program. Create a file called ​cmd_line.rb​ that contains the following:
```ruby
puts ​"You gave ​#{ARGV.size}​ arguments"​
p ARGV
```
When we run it with arguments, we can see that they get passed in:
```ruby
$ ​ruby cmd_line.rb ant bee cat dog​
```
You gave 4 arguments
```ruby
["ant", "bee", "cat", "dog"]
```
Often, the arguments to a program are the names of files that you want to process. In this case, you can use a second technique: the variable ​ARGF​ is a special kind of I/O object that acts like all the contents of all the files whose names are passed on the command line (or standard input if you don’t pass any filenames). We’ll look at that some more in ​`ARGF`​.
