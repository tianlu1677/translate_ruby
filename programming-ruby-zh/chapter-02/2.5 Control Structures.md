2.5 Control Structures
====
Ruby has all the usual control structures, such as ​if​ statements and ​while​ loops. Java, C, and Perl programmers may well get caught by the lack of braces around the bodies of these statements. Instead, Ruby uses the keyword ​end​ to signify the end of a body of all the control structures:
```ruby
today = Time.now
​if​ today.saturday?
​  puts ​"Do chores around the house"​
​​elsif​ today.sunday?​ 	
  puts ​"Relax"​​ 	
​else​​ 	
  puts ​"Go to work"​​ 	
​end​
```
Produces:
```ruby
Go to work
```
Similarly, ​while​ statements are terminated with ​end​:
```ruby 	
num_pallets = 0​ 	
weight      = 0​ 	
​while​ weight < 100 ​and​ num_pallets <= 5​ 	
  pallet  = next_pallet()  	
  weight += pallet.weight​ 	
  num_pallets += 1​ 	
​end​

```
Most statements in Ruby return a value, which means you can use them as conditions. For example, the kernel method ​gets​ returns the next line from the standard input stream or ​nil​ when the end of the file is reached. Because Ruby treats ​nil​ as a false value in conditions, you could write the following to process the lines in a file:
```ruby
​while​ line = gets​ 	
  puts line.downcase​ 	
​end​
```
Here, the assignment statement sets the variable ​line​ to either the next line of text or ​nil​, and then the ​while​ statement tests the value of the assignment, terminating the loop when it is ​nil​.

Ruby ​ statement modifiers​ are a useful shortcut if the body of an ​if​ or ​while​ statement is just a single expression. Simply write the expression, followed by ​if​ or ​while​ and the condition. For example, here’s a simple ​if​ statement:
```ruby
​if​ radiation > 3000​ 	
  puts ​"Danger, Will Robinson"​​ 	
​end​
```
Here it is again, rewritten using a statement modifier:
```ruby	
puts ​"Danger, Will Robinson"​ ​if​ radiation > 3000
```
Similarly, this ​while​ loop:
```ruby
square = 4​ 	
​while​ square < 1000​ 	
  square = square*square​ 	
​end​
```
becomes this more concise version:
```ruby
square = 4
square = square*square  ​while​ square < 1000
```
These statement modifiers should seem familiar to Perl programmers.
