5.4 Iterators and the Enumerable Module
====
The Ruby collection classes (​Array​, ​Hash​, and so on) support a large number of operations that do various things with the collection: traverse it, sort it, and so on. You may be thinking, “Gee, it’d sure be nice if ​my​ class could support all these neat-o features, too!” (If you actually thought that, it’s probably time to stop watching reruns of 1960s television shows.)

Well, your classes ​can​ support all these neat-o features, thanks to the magic of mixins and module ​Enumerable​. All you have to do is write an iterator called ​each​ , which returns the elements of your collection in turn. Mix in ​Enumerable​, and suddenly your class supports things such as ​map​ , ​include?​ , and ​find_all?​ . If the objects in your collection implement meaningful ordering semantics using the ​<=>​ method, you’ll also get methods such as ​min​ , ​max​ , and ​sort​ .
