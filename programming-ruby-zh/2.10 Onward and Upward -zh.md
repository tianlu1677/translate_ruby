2.10 本章小结(Onward and Upward）
====
很好，我们已经介绍完了Ruby的一些基本特性。我们已经找到了对象、方法、字符串、容器和正则表达式，了解了一些简单的控制结构和小巧的迭代器。本章的内容构成了学习本书的其他部分的基本知识。

随着时间的推移，是时候该前进到更高的层次了。下面我们会介绍类和对象，这两个概念是Ruby最高级别的组成部分，同时也是整个语言的基石。


Footnotes

This idea of expressing method calls in the form of messages comes from Smalltalk.

If your source files use non-ASCII characters (for example, because they’re written in UTF-8 encoding), all non-ASCII characters are assumed to be lowercase letters.

Although we talk about global and class variables here for completeness, you’ll find they are rarely used in Ruby programs. There’s a lot of evidence that global variables make programs harder to maintain. Class variables are not as dangerous—it’s just that people tend not to use them much.

Some people like to think of the association of a block with a method as a kind of argument passing. This works on one level, but it isn’t really the whole story. You may be better off thinking of the block and the method as coroutines, which transfer control back and forth between themselves.
